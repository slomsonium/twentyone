# Overview

*The year is [[1999]]. The age of adventure is long over. Modernization grips this world of magic, and now the common man must brave the new horrors of an urban society. The dawn of the 21st century approaches.* 

*And so we descend into the sprawling urban jungle of [[New Ackerman]] - the biggest city in all of the [[United Lands of Andrea]], where whispers of the past foretell the end of the world as we know it.* 

# Description

[[TWENTYONE]] is a [Dungeons & Dragons 5E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_&_Dragons_5th_edition) campaign inspired by 20th Century Boys and the Y2K scare, taking place in a modern world very similar to our own. The campaign centres around a massive conspiracy plot created by the [[New Millennium Collective]], a doomsday cult turned political party led by a mysterious figure who warns that the end of the world will come with the year [[2000]]. The plot of the campaign takes place between two major time periods - the present day of [[1999]], set in the city of [[New Ackerman]] where the main campaign takes place, and the past of [[1973]], during the [[Sariwan War]].
